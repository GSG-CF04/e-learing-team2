# The journey
 We started off by creating the folder structure, just nice and empty

 Then we started filling up the files the same way, each started as an empty page then being filled up by each team member.
 **e.g.**
 from this

  to this

  and for the last touches, we added media queries so that the website can look nice wherever its viewed

and we proceeded in the same manner for the rest of the pages in the website.
